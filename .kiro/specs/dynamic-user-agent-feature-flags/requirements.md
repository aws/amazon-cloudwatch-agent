# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the CloudWatch Agent to dynamically append feature flags to the User-Agent string in AWS CloudWatch Metrics requests based on the actual metrics being processed at runtime. The feature flags will indicate which storage types (EBS or instance store) are actively being monitored, providing better visibility into agent usage patterns and enabling more targeted support and optimization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a CloudWatch Agent operator, I want the agent to automatically append 'nvme_ebs' feature flag to the User-Agent string when EBS disk metrics are being processed, so that AWS can track EBS monitoring usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent processes any metric with the prefix 'diskio_ebs_' THEN the system SHALL append 'nvme_ebs' to the feature flags in the User-Agent string
2. WHEN multiple EBS metrics are processed in the same request THEN the system SHALL include 'nvme_ebs' only once in the feature flags
3. WHEN EBS diskio features are enabled in the agent configuration AND EBS metrics are detected THEN the system SHALL include the 'nvme_ebs' flag
4. WHEN EBS diskio features are disabled in the agent configuration THEN the system SHALL NOT include the 'nvme_ebs' flag regardless of metric detection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a CloudWatch Agent operator, I want the agent to automatically append 'nvme_is' feature flag to the User-Agent string when instance store disk metrics are being processed, so that AWS can track instance store monitoring usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent processes any metric with the prefix 'diskio_instance_store_' THEN the system SHALL append 'nvme_is' to the feature flags in the User-Agent string
2. WHEN multiple instance store metrics are processed in the same request THEN the system SHALL include 'nvme_is' only once in the feature flags
3. WHEN instance store diskio features are enabled in the agent configuration AND instance store metrics are detected THEN the system SHALL include the 'nvme_is' flag
4. WHEN instance store diskio features are disabled in the agent configuration THEN the system SHALL NOT include the 'nvme_is' flag regardless of metric detection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a CloudWatch Agent operator, I want the feature flags to be formatted correctly in the User-Agent string, so that they can be properly parsed and analyzed by AWS services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN feature flags are present THEN the system SHALL format them as 'feature:(flag1,flag2)' in the User-Agent string
2. WHEN both 'nvme_ebs' and 'nvme_is' flags are active THEN the system SHALL format them as 'feature:(nvme_ebs,nvme_is)'
3. WHEN only one flag is active THEN the system SHALL format it as 'feature:(flag_name)'
4. WHEN no feature flags are active THEN the system SHALL NOT append any feature flag section to the User-Agent string

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a CloudWatch Agent operator, I want the feature flag detection to work specifically with PutMetricData requests, so that the flags accurately reflect the metrics being sent to CloudWatch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent makes PutMetricData requests to CloudWatch THEN the system SHALL analyze the metrics in that specific request for feature flag determination
2. WHEN the agent makes other types of requests to AWS services THEN the system SHALL NOT apply dynamic feature flag logic
3. WHEN a PutMetricData request contains no diskio metrics THEN the system SHALL NOT append diskio-related feature flags
4. WHEN a PutMetricData request contains both EBS and instance store metrics THEN the system SHALL append both corresponding feature flags

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a CloudWatch Agent developer, I want the feature flag logic to be performant and not significantly impact request processing time, so that the agent maintains its current performance characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing metrics for feature flag detection THEN the system SHALL complete the analysis in less than 1ms per request
2. WHEN no diskio metrics are present THEN the system SHALL skip detailed metric analysis to minimize overhead
3. WHEN feature flags are determined THEN the system SHALL cache the User-Agent string construction to avoid repeated string operations
4. WHEN the same metric patterns are processed repeatedly THEN the system SHALL optimize for common cases to maintain performance
