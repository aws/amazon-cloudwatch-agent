# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a web application that simplifies the process of generating Amazon CloudWatch Agent configuration files. The application will provide an intuitive user interface where users can select their operating system, choose which metrics to collect (CPU, memory, disk, network, etc.), configure log file monitoring with filters, and receive a validated JSON configuration file that can be directly used with the CloudWatch Agent.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to select my operating system type, so that the generated configuration is compatible with my environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the configuration generator THEN the system SHALL display operating system options including Windows, Linux, and macOS
2. WHEN the user selects an operating system THEN the system SHALL update available metric and log options to match OS-specific capabilities
3. IF the user changes the operating system selection THEN the system SHALL reset any incompatible previously selected options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to choose which system metrics to monitor, so that I can collect only the performance data relevant to my use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the metrics selection interface THEN the system SHALL display categorized metric options including CPU, memory, disk, network, and process metrics
2. WHEN the user selects a metric category THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of specific parameters such as collection interval and measurement units
3. WHEN the user enables CPU metrics THEN the system SHALL provide options for per-CPU core monitoring and CPU utilization thresholds
4. WHEN the user enables memory metrics THEN the system SHALL provide options for available memory, used memory, and memory utilization percentage
5. WHEN the user enables disk metrics THEN the system SHALL allow selection of specific disk drives or mount points to monitor

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure log file monitoring with custom filters, so that I can collect and analyze specific log events from my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the log configuration section THEN the system SHALL allow specification of log file paths and patterns
2. WHEN the user adds a log file THEN the system SHALL provide options to configure log group name, log stream name, and retention settings
3. WHEN the user configures log filtering THEN the system SHALL allow creation of include and exclude patterns using regular expressions
4. WHEN the user sets up log parsing THEN the system SHALL provide options for timestamp extraction and multiline log handling
5. IF the selected operating system is Windows THEN the system SHALL provide options for Windows Event Log monitoring

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a cloud engineer, I want to receive a validated JSON configuration file, so that I can be confident the configuration will work correctly with the CloudWatch Agent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user completes their configuration selections THEN the system SHALL generate a JSON configuration file following the official CloudWatch Agent schema
2. WHEN the configuration is generated THEN the system SHALL validate the JSON against the CloudWatch Agent configuration schema
3. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL provide download options for the configuration file
4. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages indicating which configuration elements need correction
5. WHEN the user downloads the configuration THEN the system SHALL provide the file with appropriate naming convention and .json extension

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to preview the generated configuration before downloading, so that I can verify the settings match my requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user requests a configuration preview THEN the system SHALL display the formatted JSON configuration in a readable format
2. WHEN viewing the preview THEN the system SHALL highlight key configuration sections such as metrics, logs, and agent settings
3. WHEN the user identifies issues in the preview THEN the system SHALL allow returning to the configuration interface to make changes
4. WHEN the preview is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting for better readability

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to save and load configuration templates, so that I can reuse common configurations across multiple environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user completes a configuration THEN the system SHALL provide an option to save the configuration as a named template
2. WHEN the user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a list of previously saved templates
3. WHEN the user selects a saved template THEN the system SHALL load all configuration settings from that template
4. WHEN the user modifies a loaded template THEN the system SHALL allow saving as a new template or updating the existing one
5. WHEN the user manages templates THEN the system SHALL provide options to rename or delete existing templates

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the web application to be responsive and accessible, so that I can use it effectively on different devices and meet accessibility standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the application on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface that adapts to smaller screen sizes
2. WHEN the user navigates using keyboard only THEN the system SHALL provide proper tab order and keyboard shortcuts for all interactive elements
3. WHEN the user uses screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
4. WHEN the user has visual impairments THEN the system SHALL support high contrast mode and scalable text
5. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL achieve a performance score suitable for production use
