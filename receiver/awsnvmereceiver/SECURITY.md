# Security Considerations for AWS NVMe Receiver

## Overview

The AWS NVMe receiver requires elevated privileges to access NVMe devices and perform low-level operations. This document outlines the security requirements, measures, and best practices for secure operation.

## Required Capabilities

### CAP_SYS_ADMIN Capability

The receiver requires the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` Linux capability to perform NVMe ioctl operations. This capability is necessary for:

- Reading NVMe log pages via ioctl system calls
- Accessing device-specific information from both EBS and Instance Store devices
- Performing low-level device operations required for metrics collection

**Important**: The `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability provides broad system administration privileges. The receiver should be run with the minimum necessary privileges and proper containment.

### File System Permissions

The receiver requires read/write access to:
- `/dev/nvme*` - NVMe device files for ioctl operations
- `/sys/class/nvme/nvme*/serial` - Device serial number information
- `/sys/class/nvme/nvme*/model` - Device model information

## Security Measures Implemented

### Input Validation

#### Device Path Validation
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: All device paths are validated to prevent directory traversal attacks using `..`, `./`, and other path manipulation techniques
- **Absolute Path Validation**: Device paths must resolve to the `/dev/` directory and cannot escape this boundary
- **Character Validation**: Device names are restricted to alphanumeric characters and safe symbols (`_`, `-`)
- **Length Limits**: Device paths are limited to 255 characters, device names to 32 characters
- **Null Byte Protection**: Input is sanitized to prevent null byte injection attacks

#### Configuration Parameter Sanitization
- **Whitespace Trimming**: All configuration inputs are trimmed of leading/trailing whitespace
- **Empty Value Handling**: Empty or null configuration values are properly validated and rejected
- **Wildcard Support**: Only the `*` wildcard is supported for device discovery, other patterns are rejected
- **NVMe Device Restriction**: Only NVMe devices (`/dev/nvme*`) are allowed for monitoring

### Data Bounds Validation

#### Log Page Data Validation
- **Buffer Size Validation**: Log page data is validated to be exactly 4096 bytes (standard NVMe log page size)
- **Maximum Size Limits**: Data buffers are limited to 8KB maximum to prevent buffer overflow attacks
- **Null Data Protection**: Input data is validated to be non-null before processing
- **Magic Number Validation**: Device type is confirmed through magic number validation:
  - EBS devices: `0x3C23B510`
  - Instance Store devices: `0xEC2C0D7E`

#### Metric Value Bounds Checking
- **Reasonable Value Limits**: All metric values are validated against reasonable upper bounds to detect data corruption or malicious input
- **Overflow Protection**: uint64 to int64 conversion includes overflow detection
- **Histogram Validation**: Histogram data is validated for logical consistency and reasonable bounds

### Memory Safety

#### Buffer Management
- **Fixed Buffer Sizes**: All buffers use fixed, predetermined sizes to prevent dynamic allocation vulnerabilities
- **Bounds Checking**: All buffer operations include explicit bounds checking
- **Safe Pointer Operations**: Unsafe pointer operations are minimized and carefully validated

#### Resource Management
- **File Handle Cleanup**: Device file handles are properly closed using defer statements
- **Error Handling**: All operations include comprehensive error handling to prevent resource leaks

### Device Access Security

#### Permission Validation
- **Capability Checking**: Operations that fail due to insufficient permissions provide clear error messages indicating CAP_SYS_ADMIN requirement
- **Graceful Degradation**: The receiver gracefully handles permission errors without crashing
- **Device Existence Validation**: Device files are validated to exist before attempting access

#### ioctl Operation Security
- **Parameter Validation**: All ioctl parameters are validated before system calls
- **Error Code Interpretation**: ioctl errors are properly interpreted and mapped to meaningful error messages
- **Command Validation**: Only specific, required NVMe commands are used (Get Log Page command 0x02)

## Security Best Practices

### Deployment Recommendations

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Run the CloudWatch Agent with only the minimum required capabilities
2. **Container Security**: When running in containers, use security contexts to limit capabilities
3. **Network Isolation**: The receiver does not require network access for device operations
4. **File System Isolation**: Limit file system access to only required paths

### Monitoring and Logging

1. **Security Event Logging**: All security-related errors (permission denied, invalid paths, etc.) are logged
2. **Audit Trail**: Device access attempts and failures are logged for security auditing
3. **Error Reporting**: Security violations are reported through standard logging mechanisms

### Configuration Security

1. **Configuration Validation**: All configuration parameters are validated before use
2. **Default Security**: Default configuration uses secure settings (no devices specified = no access)
3. **Input Sanitization**: All user-provided configuration is sanitized and validated

## Threat Model

### Mitigated Threats

1. **Path Traversal Attacks**: Comprehensive path validation prevents directory traversal
2. **Buffer Overflow Attacks**: Fixed buffer sizes and bounds checking prevent overflow
3. **Injection Attacks**: Input sanitization prevents various injection attack vectors
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Proper capability management limits privilege escalation risks
5. **Data Corruption**: Metric bounds validation detects corrupted or malicious data

### Residual Risks

1. **CAP_SYS_ADMIN Requirement**: The broad nature of this capability presents inherent risks
2. **Kernel Interface Dependency**: Reliance on kernel ioctl interfaces may expose kernel vulnerabilities
3. **Device Driver Vulnerabilities**: NVMe device drivers may contain security vulnerabilities

## Compliance Considerations

### Security Standards
- Input validation follows OWASP secure coding practices
- Error handling prevents information disclosure
- Resource management prevents denial of service attacks

### Audit Requirements
- All security-relevant operations are logged
- Configuration changes are traceable
- Access attempts are recorded

## Emergency Response

### Security Incident Response
1. **Disable Receiver**: The receiver can be disabled by removing device configurations
2. **Capability Revocation**: CAP_SYS_ADMIN can be revoked to immediately stop device access
3. **Log Analysis**: Security logs provide audit trail for incident investigation

### Recovery Procedures
1. **Configuration Reset**: Invalid configurations can be reset to secure defaults
2. **Permission Restoration**: File permissions can be restored if compromised
3. **Service Restart**: The receiver can be safely restarted after security incidents
