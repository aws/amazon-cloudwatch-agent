            performance tracker provides data on the resource usage of the
            CloudWatch Agent. It is currently designed and configured to be run
            on Amazon Linux on an EC2 instance. The aim of this tracker is to
            provide information on expected resource usage of the CloudWatch
            Agent so resources can be accurately predicted/allocated to the
            CloudWatch Agent.

            To obtain this benchmarking data, an EC2 instance is started and
            CloudWatch Agent is installed on the host. A configuration file is
            generated for the agent to use with a specified number of logs
            monitored. When the test begins, the agent is started and lines are
            written to each log file monitored in the config. The lines are
            written at a specified rate for the given test. While the agent is
            running, it is also monitoring it's own resource usage so it can
            report this data. These metrics are pulled from CloudWatch and saved
            as the benchmarking data used on this website.

          <h3>Intended Use</h3>
          <p>
            With this data, CloudWatch agent customers can get a better idea of
            how the CloudWatch Agent performs under different loads. Since
            several tests are run with different load cases, customers can
            select a test that best represents a use case similar to theirs, and
            view the benchmarked resources used by CloudWatch Agent with that
            simulated configuration and load. This data should provide insights
            into how efficiently the CloudWatch Agent can be expected to run
            under a given load.
