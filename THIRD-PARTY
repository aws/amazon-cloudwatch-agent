      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
      Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
      Contributor:

         (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
         or

         (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
         modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
         Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
         Version); or

         (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence
         of its Contributions.

      This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
      or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
      the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

      2.4. Subsequent Licenses

      No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
      distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
      License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
      permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

      2.5. Representation

      Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
      Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to
      grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

      2.6. Fair Use

      This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
      applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
      equivalents.

      2.7. Conditions

      Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
      Section 2.1.

   3. Responsibilities

      3.1. Distribution of Source Form

      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
      Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
      the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
      Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
      License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
      attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
      Form.

      3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

         (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
         Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
         the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
         Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than
         the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

         (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
         License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
         license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
         recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

      3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
      provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
      the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
      Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
      Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
      License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
      under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
      the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
      Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
      License(s).

      3.4. Notices

      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
      (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
      limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
      Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
      extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

      3.5. Application of Additional Terms

      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
      Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
      behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
      such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
      You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
      liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
      disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
      jurisdiction.

   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this
   License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and
   the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file
   included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License.
   Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
   must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able
   to understand it.

   5. Termination

      5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
      compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
      Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
      Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
      ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
      non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
      come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
      Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
      notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
      first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
      from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
      Your receipt of the notice.

      5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
      infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
      counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
      directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
      You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
      2.1 of this License shall terminate.

      5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end
      user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have
      been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior
      to termination shall survive termination.

   6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of
   this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this
   License except under this disclaimer.

   7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
   such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
   not apply to You.

   8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

   9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to
   construe this License against a Contributor.

   10. Versions of the License

      10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

      10.2. Effect of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
      steward.

      10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

      10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
      Licenses

      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached. Exhibit A

      This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
      or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
      the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

      2.4. Subsequent Licenses

      No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
      distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
      License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
      permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

      2.5. Representation

      Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to
      grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

      2.6. Fair Use

      This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under

      equivalents.

      2.7. Conditions

      Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
      Section 2.1.

   3. Responsibilities

      3.1. Distribution of Source Form

      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
      Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
      the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
      Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
      License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
      attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
      Form.

      3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

         (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
         Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
         the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
         Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than
         the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

         (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
         License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
         license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
         recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

      3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
      provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
      the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
      Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
      Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
      License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
      under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
      the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
      Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
      License(s).

      3.4. Notices

      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
      (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
      limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
      Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
      extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

      3.5. Application of Additional Terms

      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
      Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
      behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
      such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
      You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
      liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
      disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
      jurisdiction.

   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this
   License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and
   the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file
   included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License.
   Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
   must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able
   to understand it.

   5. Termination

      5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
      compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
      Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
      Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
      ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
      non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
      come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
      Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
      notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
      first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
      from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
      Your receipt of the notice.

      5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
      infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
      counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
      directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
      You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
      2.1 of this License shall terminate.

      5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end
      user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have
      been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior
      to termination shall survive termination.

   6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of
   this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this
   License except under this disclaimer.

   7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
   such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
   not apply to You.

   8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

   9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to
   construe this License against a Contributor.

   10. Versions of the License

      10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

      10.2. Effect of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
      steward.

      10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

      10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
      Licenses

      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached. Exhibit A
      - Source Code Form License Notice

This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.
2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain
one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then
