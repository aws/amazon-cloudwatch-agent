# Amazon CloudWatch Agent
The Amazon CloudWatch Agent is software developed for the [CloudWatch Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html)

## Overview
The Amazon CloudWatch Agent enables you to do the following:

- Collect more system-level metrics from Amazon EC2 instances across operating systems. The metrics can include in-guest metrics, in addition to the metrics for EC2 instances. The additional metrics that can be collected are listed in [Metrics Collected by the CloudWatch Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/metrics-collected-by-CloudWatch-agent.html).
- Collect system-level metrics from on-premises servers. These can include servers in a hybrid environment as well as servers not managed by AWS.
- Retrieve custom metrics from your applications or services using the StatsD and collectd protocols. StatsD is supported on both Linux servers and servers running Windows Server. collectd is supported only on Linux servers.
- Collect logs from Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers, running either Linux or Windows Server.

Amazon CloudWatch Agent uses the open-source project [telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) as its dependency. It operates by starting a telegraf agent with some original plugins and some customized plugins.

## Building and running Amazon CloudWatch Agent 
Use the following instructions to build and run Cloudwatch Agent:
* To build Amazon CloudWatch Agent's binaries, you must [install go](https://golang.org/doc/install) and use `make build` to build the agent on Linux, Debian, Windows, MacOS. For more information on requirements,building and packaging binaries, please follow [this document](docs/build/build-run-package-cwagent-binaries.md)
* To build Amazon CloudWatch Agent's Image, you can simply use `make dockerized-build` to **build image from source** or use the below command to **build image from our latest public binaries**. For more information on building image with different platforms, please follow [this document](amazon-cloudwatch-container-insights/cloudwatch-agent-dockerfile)
```
docker buildx build -f amazon-cloudwatch-container-insights/cloudwatch-agent-dockerfile/Dockerfile .
```
### Make Targets
The following targets are available. Each may be run with `make <target>`.

| Make Target              | Description                                                          |
|:-------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `build`                  | build the agent on Linux, Debian, Windows, MacOS with amd64, arm64   |
| `release`                | build the agent and also packages it into a RPM, DEB and ZIP package |
| `clean`                  | remove build artifacts                                               |
| `dockerized-build`       | build image from source without local go environment                 |

## Features
### Log Filtering
CloudWatch agent supports log filtering, where the agent processes each log message with the filters that you specify, and only published events that pass all filters to CloudWatch Logs. See [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Agent-Configuration-File-Details.html#CloudWatch-Agent-Configuration-File-Logssection) for details.

For example, the following excerpt of the CloudWatch agent configuration file publishes logs that are PUT and POST requests to CloudWatch Logs, but excluding logs that come from Firefox:
```json
{
  "collect_list": [
    {
      "file_path": "/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/logs/test.log",
      "log_group_name": "test.log",
      "log_stream_name": "test.log",
      "filters": [
        {
          "type": "exclude",
          "expression": "Firefox"
        },
        {
          "type": "include",
          "expression": "P(UT|OST)"
        }
      ]
    },
  ]
}
```
Example with above config:
```
2021-09-27T19:36:35Z I! [logagent] Firefox Detected   // Agent excludes this 
2021-09-27T19:36:35Z POST (StatusCode: 200).  // Agent would push this to CloudWatch
2021-09-27T19:36:35Z GET (StatusCode: 400). // doesn't match regex, will be excluded
```
