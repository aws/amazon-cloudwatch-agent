# Amazon Cloudwatch Agent
The Amazon Cloudwatch Agent is software developed for the [Cloudwatch Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html)

## Overview
The Amazon CloudWatch Agent enables you to do the following:

- Collect more system-level metrics from Amazon EC2 instances across operating systems. The metrics can include in-guest metrics, in addition to the metrics for EC2 instances. The additional metrics that can be collected are listed in [Metrics Collected by the CloudWatch Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/metrics-collected-by-CloudWatch-agent.html).
- Collect system-level metrics from on-premises servers. These can include servers in a hybrid environment as well as servers not managed by AWS.
- Retrieve custom metrics from your applications or services using the StatsD and collectd protocols. StatsD is supported on both Linux servers and servers running Windows Server. collectd is supported only on Linux servers.
- Collect logs from Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers, running either Linux or Windows Server.

Amazon Cloudwatch Agent uses the open-source project [telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) as its dependency. It operates by starting a telegraf agent with some original plugins and some customized plugins.

## Building and Running from source

* Install go. For more information, see [Getting started](https://golang.org/doc/install)
* The agent uses go modules for dependency management. For more information, see [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules)

* Install rpm-build
```
sudo yum install -y rpmdevtools rpm-build
```
* Run `git submodule init && git submodule update` to fetch the code of aws-otel-collector

* Run `make build` to build the Cloudwatch Agent for Linux, Debian, Windows environment.

* Run `make release` to build the agent. This also packages it into a RPM, DEB and ZIP package.

The following folders are generated when the build completes:
```
build/bin/linux/arm64/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.rpm
build/bin/linux/amd64/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.rpm
build/bin/linux/arm64/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb
build/bin/linux/amd64/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb
build/bin/windows/amd64/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.zip
```

* Install your own build of the agent

    1. rpm package

        * `rpm -Uvh amazon-cloudwatch-agent.rpm`

    1. deb package

        * `dpkg -i -E ./amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb`

    1. windows package

        * unzip `amazon-cloudwatch-agent.zip`
        * `./install.ps1`

### Building and running container

See [Dockerfiles](amazon-cloudwatch-container-insights/cloudwatch-agent-dockerfile).

### Make Targets
The following targets are available. Each may be run with `make <target>`.

| Make Target              | Description |
|:-------------------------|:------------|
| `build`                  | `build` builds the agent for Linux, Debian and Windows amd64 environment |
| `release`                | *(Default)* `release` builds the agent and also packages it into a RPM, DEB and ZIP package |
| `clean`                  | `clean` removes build artifacts |
| `dockerized-build`       | build using docker container without local go environment |
