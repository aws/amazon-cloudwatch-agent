# Amazon CloudWatch Agent
The Amazon CloudWatch Agent is software developed for the [CloudWatch Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html)

## Overview
The Amazon CloudWatch Agent enables you to do the following:

- Collect more system-level metrics from Amazon EC2 instances across operating systems. The metrics can include in-guest metrics, in addition to the metrics for EC2 instances. The additional metrics that can be collected are listed in [Metrics Collected by the CloudWatch Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/metrics-collected-by-CloudWatch-agent.html).
- Collect system-level metrics from on-premises servers. These can include servers in a hybrid environment as well as servers not managed by AWS.
- Retrieve custom metrics from your applications or services using the StatsD and collectd protocols. StatsD is supported on both Linux servers and servers running Windows Server. collectd is supported only on Linux servers.
- Collect logs from Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers, running either Linux or Windows Server.
- Collect Open Telemetry and AWS X-Ray traces

Amazon CloudWatch Agent uses open-source projects [telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) and [opentelemetry-collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) as its dependencies. 
It operates by starting an opentelemetry collector and is capable of operating pipelines consisting of both telegraf and opentemetry components in addition to customized components.

* [Installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/install-CloudWatch-Agent-on-EC2-Instance.html)
* [Configuring the CloudWatch Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/create-cloudwatch-agent-configuration-file.html)

### Troubleshooting
* [Troubleshooting CloudWatch Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/troubleshooting-CloudWatch-Agent.html)

## Building and Running from source

* Install go. For more information, see [Getting started](https://golang.org/doc/install)
* The agent uses go modules for dependency management. For more information, see [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules)

* Install rpm-build
```
sudo yum install -y rpmdevtools rpm-build
```
* Run `make build` to build the CloudWatch Agent for Linux, Debian, Windows environment.

* Run `make release` to build the agent. This also packages it into a RPM, DEB and ZIP package.

The following folders are generated when the build completes:
```
build/bin/linux/arm64/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.rpm
build/bin/linux/amd64/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.rpm
build/bin/linux/arm64/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb
build/bin/linux/amd64/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb
build/bin/windows/amd64/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.zip
build/bin/darwin/amd64/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.tar.gz
```

* Install your own build of the agent

    1. rpm package

        * `rpm -Uvh amazon-cloudwatch-agent.rpm`

    1. deb package

        * `dpkg -i -E ./amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb`

    1. windows package

        * unzip `amazon-cloudwatch-agent.zip`
        * `./install.ps1`

    1. darwin package
        * `tar -xvf amazon-cloudwatch-agent.tar.gz`
        * `cp -rf ./opt/aws /opt`
        * `cp -rf ./Library/LaunchDaemons/com.amazon.cloudwatch.agent.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/`

### Building and running container

See [Dockerfiles](amazon-cloudwatch-container-insights/cloudwatch-agent-dockerfile).

### Make Targets
The following targets are available. Each may be run with `make <target>`.

| Make Target              | Description |
|:-------------------------|:------------|
| `build`                  | `build` builds the agent for Linux, Debian and Windows amd64 environment |
| `release`                | *(Default)* `release` builds the agent and also packages it into a RPM, DEB and ZIP package |
| `clean`                  | `clean` removes build artifacts |
| `dockerized-build`       | build using docker container without local go environment |

## Features
### Log Filtering
CloudWatch agent supports log filtering, where the agent processes each log message with the filters that you specify, and only published events that pass all filters to CloudWatch Logs. See [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Agent-Configuration-File-Details.html#CloudWatch-Agent-Configuration-File-Logssection) for details.

For example, the following excerpt of the CloudWatch agent configuration file publishes logs that are PUT and POST requests to CloudWatch Logs, but excluding logs that come from Firefox:
```json
{
  "collect_list": [
    {
      "file_path": "/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/logs/test.log",
      "log_group_name": "test.log",
      "log_stream_name": "test.log",
      "filters": [
        {
          "type": "exclude",
          "expression": "Firefox"
        },
        {
          "type": "include",
          "expression": "P(UT|OST)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
Example with above config:
```
2021-09-27T19:36:35Z I! [logagent] Firefox Detected   // Agent excludes this 
2021-09-27T19:36:35Z POST (StatusCode: 200).  // Agent would push this to CloudWatch
2021-09-27T19:36:35Z GET (StatusCode: 400). // doesn't match regex, will be excluded
```

## Usage data
By default, the CloudWatch agent sends health and performance data about itself to CloudWatch whenever it publishes metrics or logs to CloudWatch. This data incurs no costs to you. You can prevent the agent from sending this data by specifying `false` for `usage_data` in the `agent` section of the configuration. If you omit this parameter, the default of true is used and the agent sends the health and performance data. Refer to [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Agent-Configuration-File-Details.html#CloudWatch-Agent-Configuration-File-Agentsection).
