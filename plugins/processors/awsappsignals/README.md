# AWS AppSignals Processor for Amazon Cloudwatch Agent

The AWS AppSignals processor is used to reduce the cardinality of telemetry metrics and traces before exporting them to CloudWatch Logs via [EMF](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/awsemfexporter) and [X-Ray](github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/exporter/awsxrayexporter) respectively.
It reduces the cardinality of metrics/traces via 3 types of actions, `keep`, `drop` and `replace`, which are configured by users. CloudWatch Agent(CWA) customers will configure these rules with their CWA configurations.

Note: Traces support only `replace` actions and are implicitly pulled from the logs section of the CWA configuration

## Exporter Configuration

The following exporter configuration parameters are supported.

| Name                                         | Description                                                                                                       | Default |
|:---------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `resolvers`                                  | Platform processor is being configured for. Currently supports EKS. EC2 platform will be supported in the future. | [eks]   |
| `rules`                                      | Custom configuration rules used for filtering metrics/traces. Can be of type `drop`, `keep`, `replace`.           | []      |

### rules
The rules section defines the rules (filters) to be applied

| Name           | Description                                                                                                              | Default |
|:---------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| --- |
| `selectors`    | List of metrics/traces dimension matchers.                                                                               |  [] |
| `action`       | Action being applied for the specified selector. `keep`, `drop`, `replace`                                               |  "" |
| `rule_name`    | (Optional) Name of rule.                                                                                                 |  [] |
| `replacements` | (Optional) List of metrics/traces replacements to be executed. Based on specified selectors. requires `action = replace` |  [] |

#### selectors
A selectors section defines a matching against the dimensions of incoming metrics/traces.

| Name        | Description                                                   | Default |
|:------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------| ------ |
| `dimension` | Dimension of metrics/traces                                   |   ""    |
| `match`     | glob used for matching values of dimensions                   |   ""   |

### replacements
A replacements section defines a matching against the dimensions of incoming metrics/traces for which value replacements will be done. action must be `replace`

| Name               | Description                                   | Default |
|:-------------------|:----------------------------------------------| ------ |
| `target_dimension` | Dimension to replace                          |   ""   |
| `value`            | Value to replace current dimension value with |   ""   |
