### Best practices 

* Resolve the `go.sum` with `go mod tidy`. Don't bother manually resolving conflicts in this file
* When finished, ensure builds work by using `make build` or `make release`
* When unsure or blocked, do a deep dive on the `git blame` for greater context. Maybe even look for the associated PR's and ask the original authors and PR approvers
* If another automated PR arrives before your work is merged, just close your current one and save the branch
* After your PR is approved, **do a regular merge to preserve the commits**. 
* Remember to cleanup your commits because none of them will be squashed in a regular merge
